# Leetcode Deck

## Install

You should use the [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) add-on to import this deck.

When creating this deck, I used the [Syntax Highlighting For Code](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1463041493) add-on. You may want to also have it installed.

## Import 

To import the deck, go to `File -> CrowdAnki: Import from disk`. That dialog will ask for a directory. Point it to the `Leetcode` directory.
